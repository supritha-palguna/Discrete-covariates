# Discrete-covariates

The objective of this report is to use data obtained in 1999 to compare the quality of
locations in Munich. First, the data is statistically analyzed using statistical metrics
such as mean, variance, and standard deviation. Testing assumptions are checked to
decide between the parametric and nonparametric methods of testing. The Kruskal test
is then used to see if the location’s quality has a substantial impact on the rent per
square meter. Further, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney (WMW) U-test is used to see if
there are pairwise differences in rent per square meter for different location qualities.
The Wilcox test results are adjusted using the Bonferroni method to eliminate Type I
error, and the results are compared to the Wilcoxon test results.
